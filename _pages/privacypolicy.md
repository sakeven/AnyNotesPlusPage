# **Privacy Policy for AnyNotes+**

Effective Date: May 4, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how AnyNotes+ (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the app.

## **1. Data We Collect**

We collect the following types of data when you use the App:

* **Voice recordings and transcriptions**
* **Text notes and tags**
* **Audio durations and metadata**

All data is created and stored locally on your device and synchronized to your personal iCloud account using **Apple's CloudKit**. The App **does not have access** to your Apple ID or iCloud credentials.

## **2. Use of Third-Party Services**

AnyNotes+ integrates with **OpenAI API** to provide AI-powered transcription and note enhancement features. When you use these features, the relevant audio or text data may be temporarily transmitted to OpenAI’s servers for processing.

We do not store any OpenAI-transmitted data on our servers. All processing results are saved to your local device or iCloud account only.

## **3. Data Storage**

All user content is stored using **Apple iCloudKit**, associated with your private iCloud account. We do not maintain any centralized backend or database. We do not have access to your data.

## **4. Data Control**

You remain in full control of your data. Within the App, you can:

* **Export your notes and recordings**
* **Delete any data you’ve created**

When deleted, the data is removed from both your device and iCloud storage.

## **5. No User Accounts**

We do not use or require user accounts, emails, or passwords. Your identity remains anonymous, and all data is tied only to your iCloud account.

## **6. Security**

All communication with iCloud and third-party services (like OpenAI) is encrypted. However, no system is 100% secure, and we recommend users take care when sharing sensitive information.

## **7. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available inside the app and on our website.

## **8. Contact**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: [sakeven.jiang@gmail.com](mailto:sakeven.jiang@gmail.com).
